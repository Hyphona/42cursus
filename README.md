# 42cursus
The repo I use to synchronise the code from my ~home to my home (from 42 to my personal computer)

I decided to share it so you can maybe fall in love with coding just like me, feel free to try to understand/learn from the different projects

Start date: November 2023

## What is 42
42 is a tuition-free private technical institution of higher learning based on peer to peer learning, no classes, no teachers (as long as you pass the selection process, called "piscine")

42 Network has 52 campuses in 31 differents countries, the "piscine" is open to **everyone**, even without coding experiences
